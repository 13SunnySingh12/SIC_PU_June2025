Q1) What happens when we have 2 commits and we try to push? Discuss in detail.
A:
When you have two commits and try to push:
1.If the remote has no new changes:
	-> Your two local commits are pushed to the remote without any issues.
2.If the remote has new commits:
	->Git will reject your push because the remote contains changes that you don't have locally.
		To fix this, you'll need to run git pull to fetch the remote changes and merge them with your local commits.
		After merging (or resolving conflicts), you can push your changes.
3.Force Push (not recommended):
	->You can use git push --force to overwrite the remote, but this is risky as it can erase others' work.

Q2) Find out why there are no ++ and -- operators in Python.
A:
	Python doesn't have ++ and -- operators to keep the language simple and readable. Instead, it uses += 1 and -= 1 for incrementing and decrementing, 
	which are clearer and avoid potential bugs.

Q3) Find out why there are no ++ and -- operators in Python.
A:
Floating-point numbers are stored in memory using the IEEE 754 standard, which splits them into three parts:
	1.Sign bit: Indicates if the number is positive or negative.
	2.Exponent: Determines the range or scale of the number.
	3.Mantissa: Holds the actual value (precision).
	For example, in a 32-bit float:
		1 bit for the sign
		8 bits for the exponent
		23 bits for the mantissa
